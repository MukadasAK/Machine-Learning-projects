# Portfolio Projects

In this section, I list my data analytics projects along with a brief description of the technology stack used.

## Python

### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** `Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`  
**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:**  
This project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. It includes movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other details. The process involved data loading, cleaning and preprocessing, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementing Pearson’s correlation analysis to study the relationship between budget and gross earnings.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.  
**Results:** The analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while other factors showed no significant impact.

### Tech Store Sales Analysis
**Code:** `Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb`  
**Goal:** To examine the sales history of a tech store and extract insights on its performance, along with identifying potential improvements.

**Description:**  
The dataset includes sales records such as order id, order date, price, quantity ordered, and purchase address. Steps included data loading, cleaning, EDA, analyzing sales trends, and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** The project provided insights on monthly sales, city-wise performance, and the most popular items sold.

## SQL

### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** `COVID Portfolio Project.sql`  

**Description:**  
This project analyzes a dataset containing Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccine records by country (2020-2021). It covers data loading, cleaning, and performing exploratory data analysis.

**Skills:** Joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, converting data types.  
**Technology:** SQL Server.

### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** `Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql`  

**Description:**  
This project works with a dataset of houses sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. It involves data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.

**Skills:** DML (Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).  
**Technology:** SQL Server.

## R

### Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)
**Code:** `Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)`  
**Goal:** To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in classifying a Pokémon as legendary.

**Description:**  
Using a dataset of Pokémon characteristics such as attack, defense, type, and size, the project involves data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to understand the factors that differentiate legendary Pokémon.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Tidyverse.
